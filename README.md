# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a telecom customer churn dataset sourced from **Kaggle**. The goal is to uncover the driving factors behind customer churn and provide **data-driven strategic insights** to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- **Records**: 7,043 telecom customers  
- **Features**: 21 columns including customer demographics, contract details, billing methods, and service usage

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – data wrangling and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Churn Rate**: 26.5% of customers have churned  
- **Contract Type Impact**:
  - Month-to-month contracts contribute ~88% of churn
  - Long-term contracts (1-2 year) significantly reduce churn
- **Service Usage**:
  - Fiber optic users churn more (~40%) than DSL users
  - Lack of tech support and value services doubles churn likelihood
- **Demographics**:
  - Senior citizens (16% of base) represent ~30% of churn
  - Early tenure (first 5 months) churn is alarmingly high (~45%)
- **Billing & Payment Behavior**:
  - Electronic Check users show the highest churn (~45%)
  - Monthly charges > $80 correlate with high churn when unsupported by value services

## 📊 Visualization Highlights

- Churn by contract type, service usage, and demographics  
- Distribution plots for tenure, monthly charges, and total charges  
- Heatmaps and bar plots to identify churn contributors  
- A 9-panel visual grid analyzing the churn effect across bundled services

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

- 📅 Incentivize long-term contracts (1–2 years)  
- 👋 Improve onboarding for new users (first 3–6 months)  
- 🎁 Bundle tech support and online backup services
